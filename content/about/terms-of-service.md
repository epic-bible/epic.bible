If you disagree with any part of the Terms, then you do not have permission to access the Service.

## Intellectual Property

The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of [Your Company Name] and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of [Your Company Name].

## User Conduct

You agree not to use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You agree to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in your jurisdiction when using the Service. You are responsible for any activity that occurs through your account, and you must not share your account credentials with anyone else.

## Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.

## Links to Other Websites

Our Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by [Your Company Name]. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. We do not warrant the offerings of any of these entities/individuals or their websites. You acknowledge and agree that [Your Company Name] shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such third-party websites or services. We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party websites or services that you visit.

## Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless [Your Company Name] and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the Service, or b) a breach of these Terms.

## Limitation of Liability

In no event shall [Your Company Name], nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed its essential purpose.

## Changes

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.

## Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.

## Dispute Resolution

Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Service shall be resolved by arbitration under the rules of the [Your Jurisdiction's Arbitration Association]. The arbitration shall be conducted in [Your Jurisdiction] and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The prevailing party in any dispute shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
